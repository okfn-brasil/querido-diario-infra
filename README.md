=========================

This repository contains a bunch of different script to deploy the infrastructure
used in the Querido Di치rio project. Terraform is used to deploy all the Digital 
Ocean infrastructure used to run the workloads. The Terraform script deploy a
database, Kubernetes cluster, digital ocean spaces (s3ish storage) and everything
necessary to support the project applications.

Once you have the base infrastructure in place, Helm charts are used to deploy 
the some applications required to run our workloads.


# How to use it?

First of all, it is necessary sipping up the base infrastructure. For that, you 
can go to the `terraform` directory and initialize the Terraform working directory.
It will create some initial files, downloads providers and everything else that 
is necessary to run the deploy. After the initialization, you can run the command
to ask Terraform to plan the changes in your infrastructure and then, apply it. 
All the commands for the previously described process is:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

After this process, if everything run successfully, you will have a kubeconfig
file inside the `terraform` directory. This file, give you access to the Kubernetes
cluster deployed. This file is used in the further step to install some base 
applications needed by the project. For that, you export the `KUBECONFIG` environment
variable or copy the file to the `$HOME/.kube/config` file. To export the environment
variable you can use a command similar to this:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/the/querido-diario-automation/repo/terraform/kubeconfig
```

Once you did that, if you have the `kubectl` installed in the local machine, check
if you have access to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

Now you have the infrastructure in place, you can start deploy some apps in the
cluster. In this documentation we will show how to deploy two requirements to run
the Querido Di치rio project: Nginx ingress controller and Elasticsearch.

## Nginx Ingress Controller

Nginx ingress controller is used to give access to services running inside the cluster
to the external world. For that, we will create some required resources to run 
in our cloud provider (Digital Ocean) and than run the helm command to install 
the Nginx Ingress Controller chart:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v0.46.0/deploy/static/provider/do/deploy.yaml
helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
helm repo update

helm install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx
```

## Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch (a.k.a. ES) is our search index of choice. Querido Di치rio index all the crawled
documents in a ES index. So, we need to deploy it in our cluster as well. We will use
again the Helm chart available in the Elastic (ES main developer) repository:

```
helm repo add elastic https://helm.elastic.co
helm install elasticsearch --version 7.12.1 elastic/elasticsearch
```

Once you follow all these steps you should have the base infrastructure used to 
run Querido Di치rio workloads.
